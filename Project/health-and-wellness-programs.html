            <h3>Regular Medical Check-ups and Preventive Care</h3>
            <br>
            <p>Our Health Programs begin with regular medical check-ups and preventive care measures to monitor the health status of each 
                child and address any concerns proactively. From routine vaccinations and screenings
                 to dental and vision check-ups, we ensure that children receive the essential medical care they need to stay healthy and thrive.</p>
            <h3>Nutritious Meals and Dietary Education</h3>
            <br>
            <p>Healthy eating habits are fundamental to overall health and 
                well-being. That's why we prioritize nutritious meals and dietary education as 
                part of our Health Programs. Our dedicated kitchen staff prepares balanced and wholesome meals 
                that meet the nutritional needs of growing children, while educational workshops and cooking classes teach children about the
                 importance of healthy eating and how to make nutritious choices.</p>
            <h3>Physical Fitness and Recreation</h3>
            <br>
            <p>Physical activity is not only essential for physical health but also for mental and emotional well-being. Our Health Programs include 
                opportunities for children to engage in physical fitness activities and recreation, such as sports, yoga, dance, and outdoor play. 
                These activities promote physical strength, coordination, and cardiovascular health, as well as stress relief and relaxation.</p>
            <h3>Promoting Hygiene and Personal Care</h3>
            <br>
            <p>Good hygiene practices are essential for preventing illness and maintaining overall health.
                 Our Health Programs include education and training on personal hygiene practices such as handwashing, 
                 dental care, and sanitation. 
                By promoting good hygiene habits, we empower children to take responsibility for their health and well-being.</p>
