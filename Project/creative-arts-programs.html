                    <h3>Vocational Training at Zein Art School</h3>
                    <br>
                    <p>Our Zein Art School offers a diverse range of vocational training programs designed
                     to ignite creativity and develop practical skills. Under the guidance of experienced
                      instructors, children have the chance to learn various art forms, including sewing, 
                      batik, jewelry-making, mosaic, carpet weaving, carpentry, and pottery. These hands-on workshops 
                    not only provide valuable vocational skills but also foster self-expression and confidence.</p>
                    <h3>Unlocking Creativity and Potential</h3>
                    <br>
                    <p> Through our Creative Art Programs, children at Awlady Orphanage have the opportunity 
                        to explore their artistic interests, express themselves freely, and develop a sense of
                         pride in their accomplishments. Whether they're crafting intricate jewelry pieces,
                          weaving vibrant carpets, or sculpting clay masterpieces, 
                        each child is encouraged to discover their unique talents and unleash their creative potential.</p>
                        <h3>Fostering Self-Expression and Confidence</h3>
                        <br>
                        <p>Art is a universal language that allows children to express their thoughts, 
                        feelings, and experiences in a safe and non-judgmental space. Whether through 
                        painting, sculpture, or textile design, our Creative Art Programs provide children 
                        with a platform to share their stories, dreams, and aspirations. With each brushstroke 
                        or carve of clay,
                         they gain confidence in their abilities and learn to trust in their unique voice.</p>
                         <h3>Special Thanks to Lamia Hassanein and Heba Abou Hamda</h3>
                         <br>
                    <p>We extend our heartfelt gratitude to Lamia Hassanein and Heba Abou Hamda, the pioneers 
                        of our Zein Art School project. Their vision, dedication, and passion for art education have transformed 
                        the lives of countless children, offering them a path to creativity, self-discovery, and personal growth.</p>
